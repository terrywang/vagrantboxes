**Handcrafted** Vagrant Base Boxes for [vagrantbox.es](http://vagrantbox.es).

# Distros

List of boxes currently maintained

- Arch Linux x86_64
- ~~Fedora 33 (to be added)~~
- ~~Oracle Linux 7.6 x86_64~~
- ~~Oracle Linux 6.9 x86_64~~
- ~~Oracle Linux 5.11 x86_64~~

> The initial intention was to package my favourite `Arch Linux` virtual machine into Vagrant box form, to be used as building blocks, which can be easily thrown into development & testing scenarios, fit very well into `Ops` workflows & pipelines in a `burn after using` fashion.
>
> Over time, the curated practices has evolved into a collection of: 1. must-have (or good to have) packages 2. SysAdmin / Ops best practices and 3. important and/or notable changes for listed distros

Veewee definitions are in [`veewee/definitions`](https://github.com/terrywang/vagrantboxes/tree/master/veewee/definitions) to automate the building of Vagrant Base Boxes;-) Check its [README.md](https://github.com/terrywang/vagrantboxes/blob/master/veewee/README.md) for usage.

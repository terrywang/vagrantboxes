> **NOTE**: Veewee definitions are to be added to automate the building of Vagrant Base Boxes;-) 

Additional list of places where you can get all sorts of vagrant base boxes for different purposes: development, testing, or even production.

- [**vagrantboxe.es**](http://vagrantbox.es)

 A List of vagrant base boxes. Initiated by Gareth Rushgrove `@garethr` hosted on Heroku using Nginx. See the story here: [**The Vagrantboxe.es Story**](http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/07/01/The-vagrantbox.es-story/).

- **Opscode** [**bento**](https://github.com/opscode/bento)

 We all know what **bento** means in Japanese, right? In this case, they are **NOT** lunch boxes **BUT** extremely handy base boxes which can be grabbed quickly to test cookbooks or private chef (Chef Server and Client).
Distributions included: Ubuntu Server, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.

 > NOTE: To find hidden bento boxes, access the context root of the AWS S3 server;-)

- [**Puppet Labs Vagrant Boxes**](http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/)
 
 Pre-built vagrant boxes, ready for use. Made by the folks at Puppet Labs.

- [**Vagrant Ubuntu Cloud Images**](http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/)

 It’s been there since Jan, 2013. For some reason Canonical has NOT officially promoted it yet, may be still in beta. Remember these are vanilla images, NOT very useful without Chef or Puppet.

If you are looking for Virtual Machines with server applications (e.g. GitLab, Discourse, WordPress, Redmine, Ruby Stack, Joomla!, Drupal etc…) pre-installed and configured, try Bitnami Stacks, it rocks!
